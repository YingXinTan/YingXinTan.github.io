## TRC 5901: How deep is too deep?

**Project description:** This is a project to wrap up a Level 5 unit in the Monash School of Engineering. The purpose of this project was to provide us students a simple research project studying the effects of varying convolution layers on the prediction accuracies of a model. To test our skills on verbal and written communication, the project required 2 final submissions: a final written report intended for a technical audience and a 3 minute video pitch intended for a general audience. 

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript

  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
